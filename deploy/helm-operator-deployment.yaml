      # The following volume is for using a customised known_hosts file,
      # which you will need to do if you host your own git repo rather
      # than using github or the like. You'll also need to mount it
      # into the container, below.
      #
      # You may also wish to provide an ssh_config file,
      # mentioning more than one `IdentityFile`; for instance, if you're
      # using more than one GitHub repo. NB the entry key should be
      # "config" rather than "ssh_config" if mounted in ~/.ssh/.

      #
      # You will need this volume if you're using a git repo that
      # needs an SSH key for access; e.g., a GitHub deploy key. If
      # you're using just one such repo, the default ssh_config
      # already points at /etc/fluxd/ssh/identity as a key. If you
      # want to use more than one key, you'll need to provide your own
      # ssh_config above, with an `IdentityFile` entry matching each
      # key in the secret mentioned here.

      #
      # These two volumes are for mounting a repositories.yaml file,
      # and providing a cache directory. The latter is needed because
      # mounting the former will make the cache/ directory read-only.
